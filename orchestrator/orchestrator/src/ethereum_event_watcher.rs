///
/// Obviously we must chose some delay in order to prevent incorrect events from being claimed
///
/// For EVM chains with finality the correct value for this is zero. As there's no need
/// to concern ourselves with re-orgs or forking. This function checks the netID of the
/// provided Ethereum RPC and adjusts the block delay accordingly

/// The value used here for Ethereum is a balance between being reasonably fast and reasonably secure
/// As you can see on https://etherscan.io/blocks_forked uncles (one block deep reorgs)
/// occur once every few minutes. Two deep once or twice a day.
/// https://etherscan.io/chart/uncles
/// Let's make a conservative assumption of 1% chance of an uncle being a two block deep reorg
/// (actual is closer to 0.3%) and assume that continues as we increase the depth.
/// Given an uncle every 2.8 minutes, a 6 deep reorg would be 2.8 minutes * (100^4) or one

/// Of course the above assume that no mining attacks occur. Once we bring that potential into
