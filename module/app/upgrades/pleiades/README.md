# Pleiades UPGRADE
> The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, is claimed to have been used as an ancient eye test. If someone is able to see all seven stars unassisted, they have excellent vision. This upgrade is named Pleiades because the correction it makes to batches is hard to spot.

The *Pleiades* upgrade contains the following changes.

## Summary of Changes

* Migrate all batches to a new key format
* Add new CLI and gRPC endpoints to return Attestations, LastObservedEthereumBlockHeight, and LastObservedEthereumEventsNonce, enabling tools like Telescope to get a better picture of the current bridge status
